# Genetic Drawing


Examples of generated images:

![](imgs/img1.gif) <img src="imgs/img2.gif" width="380">

It also supports user-created sampling masks, in case you'd like to specify regions where more brushstrokes are needed (for ex, to allocate more finer details)

## Python
you would need the following python 3 libraries:

* opencv 3.4.1

To start, open the GeneticDrawing.ipynb and run the example code
